# Residual Network
I implemented ResNet("Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition") with keras for CIFAR10.
# Environment Settings
Keras version: '2.2.4'
# Example to run the codes
`python3.6 main.py --res_block_num 5`
# Dataset
I loaded CIFAR10 dataset in the code using keras. I trained the model on 50000 images and evaluated it on 10000 images.
